In this week's assignment, you will need to create your own JSON document to store information about yourself and the grades you've received from week 1 to week 4 and the week 6 quiz.  That is, everything you should have received a grade for.  Then you'll need to show me you know how to navigate the JSON in that file.\n",

JSON's structured format makes it easy to read and work with, and Python's `json` library simplifies parsing and manipulating data. However, challenges arise with deeply nested JSON structures, where managing and accessing data becomes more complex. Colab's cloud-based environment is convenient for executing Python code without local setup, but it can be resource-limited when handling large datasets or long processes. Overall, I enjoyed the interactivity of Colab and the flexibility Python offers in dealing with JSON, though some aspects, like debugging complex structures or managing performance, were more difficult than expected. The experience was rewarding but required attention to detail."
